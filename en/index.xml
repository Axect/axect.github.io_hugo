Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re presented with an unnormalized probability density function graph such as the one shown. If you&amp;rsquo;re tasked with generating 10,000 data points that conform to this distribution, what would be your approach?
Here are the two most commonly used methods to sample data from an arbitrary probability density function:
Inverse Transform Sampling Rejection Sampling Inverse Transform Sampling involves generating data points by calculating the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the probability density function, deriving its inverse function, and then using this inverse function to produce data points.</description>

The most pervasive challenge in deep learning is Overfitting . This occurs when the dataset is small, and extensive training leads to a model that excels on training datasets but fails to generalize to validation datasets or real-world scenarios. To address this issue, various strategies have been developed. Historically, in statistics, regularization methods like Ridge and LASSO were employed, while deep learning has adopted approaches such as regularizing weights or applying different techniques to neural networks.</description>
